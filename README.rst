Octopress Theme for Pelican
===========================

This is a theme for `Pelican`_ that looks like `Octopress`_ default theme. I wrote this
theme for `my personal blog`_.

Why use this theme?
-------------------

I really like Octopress default theme, I think is enough pretty and very readable. On the other
hand I don't like any of the themes currently available for Pelican. As I'm not able to write a
nice theme from scratch I've just copied the Octopress' one.

Why didn't you use Octopress?
-----------------------------

I've started writing my blog with Octopress but I haven't found a way to easily have a
multi-language blog without hacking more than the time I was planning to spend to setup my blog.
You can argue that the time spent to copy the Octopress' theme is more than adding a
multi-language feature for Octopress.. I'm not sure of that since I've no idea what kind of
changes Octopress required to support multiple language per post.

I've found out that I like more the organization of Pelican: Octopress/Jekyll have a unique
repository you have to fork, so its code is mixed with your blog's data. Pelican instead separates
the two things. Also Pelican is written in Python that I know way better than Ruby.

The theme is missing `XXX`
--------------------------

I've started writing this theme just for my blog and my blog required few template pages and few
features. If you want to add `XXX` please be free to fork this repository and submit a pull request,
I'll be happy to merge it!
