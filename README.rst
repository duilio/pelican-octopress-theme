Octopress Theme for Pelican
===========================

This is a theme for `Pelican`_ that looks like `Octopress`_ default theme. I wrote this
theme for `my personal blog`_.

Why use this theme?
-------------------

I really like Octopress default theme, I think is enough pretty and very readable. On the other
hand I don't like any of the themes currently available for Pelican. As I'm not able to write a
nice theme from scratch I've just copied the Octopress' one.

Why didn't you use Octopress?
-----------------------------

I've started writing my blog with Octopress but I haven't found a way to easily have a
multi-language blog without hacking more than the time I was planning to spend to setup my blog.
You can argue that the time spent to copy the Octopress' theme is more than adding a
multi-language feature for Octopress.. I'm not sure of that since I've no idea what kind of
changes Octopress required to support multiple language per post.

I've found out that I like more the organization of Pelican: Octopress/Jekyll have a unique
repository you have to fork, so its code is mixed with your blog's data. Pelican instead separates
the two things. Also Pelican is written in Python that I know way better than Ruby.

The theme is missing `XXX`
--------------------------

I've started writing this theme just for my blog and my blog required few template pages and few
features. If you want to add `XXX` please be free to fork this repository and submit a pull request,
I'll be happy to merge it!

FeedBurner integration
----------------------

- ``FEED_FEEDBURNER``: set this to the part of your FeedBurner URL after the ``http://feeds.feedburner.com/`` to set the
  displayed feed URL to your FeedBurner URL. This also disables generation of the RSS and ATOM tags, regardless of whether
  you've set the ``FEED_RSS`` or ``FEED_ATOM`` variables. This way, you can arbitrarily set your generated feed URL while
  presenting your FeedBurner URL to your users.

  of your Disqus site. Example:
  ``mrsenko``


Isso self-hosted comments
-------------------------

`Isso`_ is intended to be a Free replacement for systems like Disqus. Because
it is self-hosted, it gives you full control over the comments posted to your
website.

- ``ISSO_SITEURL``: (required to enable) set this to the URL of the server Isso
  is being served from without a trailing slash. Example:
  ``http://example.com``

**NOTE:** comments are displayed only if the article is not a draft and
``SITEURL`` is defined (usually is) and either one of ``DISQUS_SITENAME`` or
``ISSO_SITEURL`` are defined!

Disqus Identifier
-----------------

If you are migrated from wordpress or any CMS to pelican, the disqus identifier is different there. In pelican the disqus identifier is URL of an article. So you will lose Disqus discussion for that article because Disqus identifier for that article is changed. To override the disqus identifier of an article

- ``disqus_identifier``: set this property in your article meta data. Set it to any unique string you want. It won’t be affected by the article URL.

If you choose not to use ``disqus_identifier``, defaults article URL passes to Disqus as identifier.  

X min read
----------

medium.com like "X min read" feature. You need to activate the plugin
``post_stats`` for this to work (default values are shown):

- ``X_MIN_READ``: ``False``

Favicon
-------

- ``FAVICON_FILENAME``: set to path of your favicon. The default is empty in
  which case the template will use the hardcoded address ``favicon.png``.

- ``MENUITEMS_MIDDLE``: ``()`` show static links (between pages and categories)
  e.g.: ``MENUITEMS_MIDDLE = ( ('link1', '/static/file1.zip'), )``
- ``MENUITEMS_AFTER``: ``()`` show static links (after categories)
  e.g.: ``MENUITEMS_AFTER = ( ('link2', '/static/file2.pdf'), )``

Markup for Social Sharing
-------------------------

In order to specify page title, description, image and other metadata for
customized social sharing (e.g.
`Twitter cards <https://dev.twitter.com/cards/overview>`_), you can add
the following metadata to each post:

- ``title``: The title of the post. This is expected for any post.
- ``description``: A long form description of the post.
- ``social_image``: A path to an image, relative to ``SITEURL``. This image
                    will show up next to the other information in social
                    shares.
- ``twitter_site``: A Twitter handle, e.g. ``@getpelican`` for the owner
                    of the site.
` ``twitter_creator``: A Twitter handle, e.g. ``@getpelican`` for the author
                       of the post.

In addition, you can provide a default post image (instead of setting
``social_image`` in the post metadata), by setting ``SOCIAL_IMAGE`` in your
``pelicanconf``.

These can be used for social sharing on Google+, Twitter, and Facebook as
well as provide more detailed page data for Google Search. In order
to enable in each respective channel, your post metadata needs to specify:

- ``title``: The title of the post. This is expected for any post.

- ``use_schema_org: true``: For Google and Google+ specific meta tags.
- ``use_open_graph: true``: For Facebook specific meta tags.
- ``use_twitter_card: true``: For Twitter specific meta tags.
